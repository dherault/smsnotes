### What it should look like

user: Hello I am dherault

server: Hello dherault nice to meet you I am SMSNote, what is your password ?

user: coconut1234

server: You're all set dherault! 
You should delete your previous SMS just to be sure.
To change your password just send "/setPassword [your new password]".
If you need anything send "/help".
You can start writting notes right away!
